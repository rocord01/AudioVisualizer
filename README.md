# Audio Visualizer based on Three.js [BETA]
### By RoCord

I wanted to use the Web Audio API, so made this music visualizer. This is not compatible with mobile devices (Phone, Tablet, etc.)

<!-- > This version currently is has no difference from the **main** branch. -->
> Current beta version: **1.3**.
> **How to use:** Just upload any mp3 file and watch the bubble do weird things!

## Update Changelist
<pre>
v1.3 (CURRENT BETA): Now only shows fullscreen button on audio upload
v1.2 (CURRENT): Fixed some issues with the buttons being too large on some devices
v1.1: Added fullscreen button
v1.0: Uploaded to GitHub
</pre>
