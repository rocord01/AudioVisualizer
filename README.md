# Audio Visualizer based on Three.js
### By RoCord

I wanted to use the Web Audio API, so made this music visualizer. The basic idea came from a pen I found here on codepen itself ( will link to it as soon as I find it ).

> **How to use:** Just upload any mp3 file and watch the bubble do weird things!
