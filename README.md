# Audio Visualizer based on Three.js [BETA]
### By RoCord

I wanted to use the Web Audio API, so made this music visualizer. This is not compatible with mobile devices (Phone, Tablet, etc.)

> This version currently is has no difference from the *main* branch.

> **How to use:** Just upload any mp3 file and watch the bubble do weird things!
